## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

**Frontend**: Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI
**Backend**: NodeJS, MySQL, Auth.js(NextAuth)

This is a full-stack e-commerce app created with Next.js. Users can browse items by rooms or types of furniture, and add items to cart once they sign in with NextAuth. By utilizing various React libraries such as React Slick and Swiper, I was able to deliver a more engaging and interactive user experience. 

## Lessons Learned:

In this project, I was able to delve into some new areas of React development that could further enrich my skill set and solidify my problem solving abilities. One of the highlights was integrating new React libraries; navigating through the process of understanding the documentation, installing dependencies and seamlessly integrating them into the project was certainly challenging but was also very rewarding. 

This was also my first time utilizing the 'useContext' hook. Using the 'useContext' hook allowed me to efficiently manage and share state across various components, which ultimately helped me to keep my code more organized and maintainable.

## Future Improvements:

The application is not yet fully responsive. I hope to make some changes in the near future with Tailwind CSS. Furthermore, since it is an e-commerce application, I would like to implement a simulation of the real payment process. The users' orders are stored in database without a payment for now.
